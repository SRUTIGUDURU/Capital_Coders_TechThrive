Problem statement: Credit card companies struggle to provide personalized offers and advertisements that effectively engage existing customers. Current promotional strategies are often too generic and miss the opportunity to target specific customer preferences based on their spending habits and other personal data (age, education, gender etc).
Leverage of Credit Card Transaction Data: By analyzing transaction data, we're tapping into real consumer behavior rather than relying solely on assumptions or survey data. This provides a more accurate and actionable understanding of customer preferences and spending patterns.
Tailored Advertisements and Deals: Offering advertisements and deals that are not only personalized but also timely and contextually relevant helps create a unique customer experience, fostering loyalty and increasing sales.
